## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project, I learned how to do custom form validation with JavaScript. Besides getting it to work in JavaScript, I also learned how to apply styling specifically to a form for this purpose.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing JavaScript form validation so I get more comfortable with it.
